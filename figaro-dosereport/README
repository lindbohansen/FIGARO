setup-master
id: unique identifier for each experimental unit
type: unique identifier for the type of experimental unit
rotation: unique identifier for each subexposure 
(subexposures occur e.g. when units are rotated in the field)
position: unique identifier for each position in the field

setup-types
type: unique identifier for the type of experimental unit
x: width of experimental unit in the horizonthal direction perpendicular to central field axis
(e.g. size in the direction straight out from the door)
y: height of experimental unit in the vertical direction perpendicular to central field axis
(e.g. size in the direction from the floor and upwards)
z: length of experimental unit along the direction of the central field axis
(e.g. size in the direction straight out from the source towards the backwall)
approximateshape: simple geometrical shape that approximates the actual shape of an experimental unit
(e.g. box, cylinder)
actualshape: the actual shape of an experimental unit
(e.g. 96-well well plates)
materials: the main materials in a type of experimental unit
(e.g. water-plexiglass)

setup-rotations
rotation: unique identifier for each subexposure
(subexposures occur e.g. when units are rotated in the field)
exposurestart: ISO-8601 fomat UTC date and time for when the beam is opened
exposurestop: ISO-8601 format UTC date and time for when the beam is closed
(ISO-8601 format UTC date and time, FIGARO regular: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+01:00)
(ISO-8601 format UTC date and time, FIGARO summer: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+02:00)
(all rotations must have paired exposurestart and exposurestop entries)
(add as many paired exposurestart and exposurestop entries as required)

setup-positions
position: unique identifier for each position in the field
X: distance from central field axis to setup midpoint along the horizonthal direction perpendicular to central field axis
Y: distance from floor to setup lowest point along the vertical direction perpendicular to central field axis
Z: distance from source focus to setup front face along the direction of the central field axis
(Z is found by measuring distance from setup front face to exit face of collimator and adding 41.7 cm)

absorbed-doserates
type: unique identifier for the type of experimental unit
position: unique identifier for each position in the field
minFrontAirKermaRate: smallest simulated air kerma rate across front face of setup
maxFrontAirKermaRate: largest simulated air kerma rate across front face of setup
meanFrontAirKermaRate: mean simulated air kerma rate across front face of setup
minAbsorbedDoseRate: smallest simulated absorbed dose rate to setup
(reflects that absorbed dose rates vary with position)
maxAbsorbedDoseRate: largest simulated absorbed dose rate to setup
(reflects that absorbed dose rates vary with position)
wholesetupAbsorbedDoseRate: the simulated absorbed dose rate to the whole setup
absorbedDoseRateToWhat: the material for which the absorbed dose rate refers to
(e.g. if absorbedDoseRateToWhat is water, than the absorbed dose rates are absorbed dose rates to water)
